## exec-labor tone rewrite: alarmism and inversions removed (2026-04-24)

`schema_version: 1` | `date: 2026-04-24`

`slides/tech-talks/exec-labor.md` underwent a comprehensive tone rewrite to remove two banned patterns (see `exec-talks/preferences.md`):
1. "Not X, it's Y" rhetorical inversions — 11 instances removed
2. Alarmist urgency framing — 10+ instances removed

**Slide titles changed:**
- "The Cost of Every Deferred Quarter" → "Why This Quarter"
- "Governance: The Highest Financial Exposure" → "Governance: The Clearest ROI Case"
- "What Each Quarter Costs" → "Three Compounding Factors"

**Build:** ✓ clean, zero warnings after rewrite.

**Still to retrofit:** `slides/tech-talks/exec-delivery.md`, `slides/tech-talks/exec-economics.md`, and the corresponding `tech-talks/exec-*/README.md` files.

`slides/index-custom.html` updated: new "Executive Framing" sub-group added to the Tech Talks section with cards for exec-delivery, exec-economics, exec-labor. Old dead `/exec-talks/` section (pointing to non-existent paths) removed entirely.

## exec-talks folder retired — exec talks unified into tech-talks (2026-04-23)

`schema_version: 1` | `date: 2026-04-23`

The `slides/exec-talks/` folder no longer exists. All executive talk slide decks (`exec-delivery.md`, `exec-labor.md`, `exec-economics.md`, `exec-spine.md`, `exec-strategy.md`) have moved to `slides/tech-talks/`. Executive talks are now treated identically to tech-talks for slide generation and building — the only distinction is the recipe review skill (`exec-recipe-review` vs `deck-recipe-review`).

`build-all.ps1` and `build.ps1` updated: `exec-talks` removed from `[ValidateSet]`, `$Categories`, `$CategoryConfig`, and output dir creation.
