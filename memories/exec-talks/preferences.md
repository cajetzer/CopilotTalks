# exec-talks / preferences

Voice, tone, and framing preferences for executive-audience talks.

## Exec-talk voice rules: no alarmism, no "not X it's Y", no you/yours (2026-04-24)

`schema_version: 1` | `date: 2026-04-24`

These rules were established by reviewing exec-labor slides. Apply to all exec-talk slide generation and README writing.

### Banned: Second-person framing (you / your / yours)

Never address the audience as "you" or "your". Executive briefings speak in the third person about organizations, leaders, teams, and developers.

**Examples of what NOT to write:**
- "whether **your** organization can capture this change"
- "Are **your** developers equipped to fly?"
- "agentic AI is **your** autopilot"
- "the cheapest line in **your** risk budget"
- "**Your** developers are becoming pilots"
- "**You** cannot fly multiple aircraft without instruments"
- "That data is **your** business case"

**Fix:** Reframe with "an organization", "the organization", "developers", "leaders", "the team", or passive constructions.
- ✅ "whether **an organization** can capture this change"
- ✅ "Are developers equipped to fly?"
- ✅ "agentic AI is **the** autopilot"
- ✅ "the most cost-effective line in **an organization's** risk budget"
- ✅ "Developers are becoming pilots"
- ✅ "Instrument coverage is the prerequisite for multi-session flight"
- ✅ "That data is the business case for scaling"

**First applied:** exec-delivery README (2026-04-24). Also needs retrofit on exec-economics and exec-labor READMEs.

### Banned: "Not X, it's Y" constructions

Never use this rhetorical pattern. Rewrite to state only the positive claim.

**Examples of what NOT to write:**
- "The organizations moving fastest are **not** those with the most developers — **they are** those who..."
- "**These are not** technology failure costs. **They are** structural labor gaps."
- "**These are not** projections. **They are** what organizations are measuring."
- "Automated governance pays for itself — **manual review does not scale**."
- "**Inaction is not neutral**..."
- "**The gap is not paused** while you decide."
- "**not** after audit" / "**not** API cost" / "**not** next year"
- "**not** a catch-up response" / "**not** a future state"
- "The **absence of policy is itself a policy**" (same rhetorical move)

**Fix:** State the positive claim directly and move on.

### Banned: Alarmist urgency framing

Never frame inaction as threat. Never imply the audience is falling behind or at risk if they don't act now. Present opportunity, not fear.

**Patterns to avoid:**
- "risk surface you are carrying **undefended**"
- "**gap widens** every deferred quarter" / "every quarter of deferral"
- "**The Cost of Every Deferred Quarter**" (slide title pattern)
- "**Inaction does not hold position**" / "**Inaction is not neutral**"
- "**the window is now**" / "**the window is closing**"
- "**compounding cost** of delay" / "**compound silently**"
- "**exposure**" used as a threat label (e.g. "$4.88M exposure" — say "$4.88M avg breach cost")
- "**carrying undefended**"
- "**catch-up necessity**"
- "**structural cost advantage**" framing competitors as a threat

**Fix:** State the same data as opportunity or factual context. "Elite teams deploy 208x more frequently" — not "the gap widens every quarter you delay."

### Preferred voice for exec-talks

- **Factual and direct.** State what is true. Trust the executive to draw implications.
- **Opportunity-framed.** "The 67% is ready to move" — not "67% is still untouched."
- **Positive comparison.** "Organizations that have started have an 18–24 month head start" — not "you are 18–24 months behind."
- **Data as context, not threat.** DORA 208x is a benchmark, not a warning. $4.88M is a cost structure, not a scare stat.
- **Section titles describe what the audience gets**, not what they are losing. "The Business Case" or "The ROI Evidence" — not "The Exposure Ledger" or "What Each Quarter Costs."

### Applied in exec-labor (2026-04-24)

These patterns were removed from `slides/tech-talks/exec-labor.md` and the replacement style is visible there. Use exec-labor as the reference for correct exec-talk voice.

**Still to retrofit:** `slides/tech-talks/exec-delivery.md`, `slides/tech-talks/exec-economics.md`, and the corresponding `tech-talks/exec-*/README.md` files.
